<!-- Installation -->

# Installation

### Important Version Control

- Please check the current Lava node version before installing the lava-sdk.

- Make sure you are using the `"Latest"` tag. You can check the latest releases here: https://github.com/lavanet/lava/releases

- lava-sdk releases can be found here: https://github.com/lavanet/lava-sdk/releases or in the npm official site: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lavanet/lava-sdk

### For Example

If lava latest release version is `v0.8.0` or any minor version such as v0.8.1 ‚û°Ô∏è sdk version will be `v0.8.0`

---

### Prerequisites
During `lava-testnet-2`, there are a few additional steps to becoming operational with the SDK. To get started with LavaSDK, please create an account on the [Lava Gateway](https://gateway.lavanet.xyz?utm_source=sdk-readme&utm_medium=npm%20/%20github)

Presently, you can use the SDK in two ways:
1. Badges
   This is the route recommended for frontend applications. Badges are used so that you don't have to expose your private keys in code. Every user is assigned a usable projectId with the creation of a project on our gateway. Simply navigate to the APIs you would like to use, click `Lava SDK`, and copy and paste the `badge` in your SDK initialization code to get started.
2. Private Keys
   This is the route recommended for backend applications. Select `settings` under your project and add your private key under `Project Keys`. Don't have a private key and need one? No worries, you can generate a Private Key right on the gateway for added ease of use. 

You'll be able to monitor usage, project manage, and put configurations in place from the Gateway all while continuing to use Lava's P2P network.

Need help? We've got you covered üòª Head over to our [Discord](https://discord.gg/5VcqgwMmkA) channel `#lava-sdk` and we'll provide further support!

### Yarn

```bash
yarn add @lavanet/lava-sdk
```

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

# Usage

A single instance of the SDK establishes a connection with a specific blockchain network using a single RPC interface. _Need multiple chains or use multiple RPC interfaces? Create multiple instances._

To use the SDK, you will first need to initialize it.

```typescript
const lavaSDK = await new LavaSDK({
  privateKey?: string; // Required: The private key of the staked Lava client for the specified chainID
  badge?: BadgeOptions; // Required: Public URL of badge server and ID of the project you want to connect. Remove privateKey if badge is enabled.
  chainIds: ChainIDsToInit; // Required: The ID of the chain you want to query or an array of chain ids example "ETH1" | ["ETH1", "LAV1"]
  pairingListConfig?: string; // Optional: The Lava pairing list config used for communicating with the Lava network
  network?: string; // Optional: The network from pairingListConfig to be used ["mainnet", "testnet"]
  geolocation?: string; // Optional: The geolocation to be used ["1" for North America, "2" for Europe ]
  lavaChainId?: string; // Optional: The Lava chain ID (default value for Lava Testnet)
  secure?: boolean; // Optional: communicates through https, this is a temporary flag that will be disabled once the chain will use https by default
  allowInsecureTransport?: boolean; // Optional: indicates to use a insecure transport when connecting the provider, this is used for testing purposes only and allows self-signed certificates to be used
  logLevel?: string | LogLevel; // Optional for log level settings, "debug" | "info" | "warn" | "error" | "success" | "NoPrints"
  transport?: any; // Optional for transport settings if you would like to change the default transport settings. see utils/browser.ts for the current settings
});

const badgeOptions: BadgeOptions = {
    badgeServerAddress: serverAddress, // string (Required)
    projectId: projectIdValue, // string (Required)
    authentication: authValue, // string (Optional)
};
```

Lava SDK options:

- `badge` parameter specifies the public URL of the badge server and the ID of the project you want to connect to. If you enable the badge, you should remove the `privateKey`

- `privateKey` parameter is required and should be the private key of the staked Lava client for the specified `chainID`

- `chainIds` parameter is required and should be an ID or a list of chain IDs depending how many chains you would like to initialize (https://github.com/lavanet/lava-sdk/blob/main/supportedChains.json)

- `rpcInterface` is an optional parameter representing the interface that will be used for sending relays. For cosmos chains it can be `tendermintRPC` or `rest`. For evm compatible chains `jsonRPC` or `rest`. You can find the list of all default rpc interfaces [supportedChains](https://github.com/lavanet/lava-sdk/blob/main/supportedChains.json)

- `pairingListConfig` is an optional parameter that specifies the lava pairing list config used for communicating with lava network. Lava SDK does not rely on one centralized rpc for querying lava network. It uses a list of rpc providers to fetch list of the providers for specified `chainID` and `rpcInterface` from lava network. If not pairingListConfig set, the default list will be used [default lava pairing list](https://github.com/lavanet/lava-providers/blob/main/pairingList.json)

- `network` is an optional parameter that specifies the network from pairingListConfig which will be used. Default value is `testnet`

- `geolocation` is an optional parameter that specifies the geolocation which will be used. Default value is `1` which represents North America providers. Besides North America providers, lava supports EU providers on geolocation `2`

- `lavaChainId` is an optional parameter that specifies the chain id of the lava network. Default value is `lava-testnet-2` which represents Lava testnet

- `secure` is an optional parameter which indicates whether the SDK should communicate through HTTPS. This is a temporary flag that will be disabled once the chain uses HTTPS by default

- `allowInsecureTransport` is an optional parameter which indicates whether to use an insecure transport when connecting to the provider. This option is intended for testing purposes only and allows for the use of self-signed certificates

- `debug` is an optional parameter used for debugging the LavaSDK. When enabled, it mostly prints logs to speed up development

Badge options:

- `badgeServerAddress` is an optional parameter that specifies the public URL of the badge server

- `projectId` is an optional parameter that represents the ID of the project you want to connect to

- `authentication` is an optional parameter that specifies any additional authentication requirements

### Private keys vs Badge server

In the LavaSDK, users have the option to authenticate using either a private key or a badge server. Both methods have their advantages and specific use cases. Let's dive into the details of each:

#### Private Key:

The private key is the quickest way to start using the LavaSDK. All you need is the private key of an account that has staked both for the Lava Network and the chain you wish to query. With this, you can immediately begin utilizing the functionalities of the LavaSDK.

However, it's crucial to note that using a private key directly, especially in a browser environment, comes with security risks. If a user exposes their private key in a browser-based application, malicious actors can easily discover it and exploit it for their purposes. As such, direct usage of the private key should be limited to server-side operations or browser testing environments. It's not recommended for production-level applications, especially those that run client-side.

#### Badge Server:

The Badge server is a dedicated Go service that clients can initiate. It acts as an intermediary between the LavaSDK and the Lava Network, ensuring that no secrets or private keys are stored directly within the SDK. Instead, all sensitive information is securely held on the Badge server, with the LavaSDK only communicating with this server.

The primary advantage of using the Badge server is the enhanced security it offers. Additionally, the Badge server pre-updates some information like pairing list for current epoch, allowing the LavaSDK to fetch data more rapidly by merely pinging the server. This results in faster and more efficient operations.

However, there are some challenges to consider. Users need to bootstrap and maintain the Badge server, which might require additional resources and expertise. For those interested in exploring the Badge server without setting up their own, we have deployed a Lava Test Badge server. You can access and experiment with it through our gateway application at [Lava Gateway](https://accounts.lavanet.xyz/)

For detailed instructions on how to start the Badge server, refer to our [documentation](https://github.com/lavanet/lava/blob/main/protocol/badgegenerator/Readme.md)

### Examples:

# Badge full flow example:

```typescript
async function getLatestBlock(): Promise<string> {
  // Create dAccess for Ethereum Mainnet
  // Default rpcInterface for Ethereum Mainnet is jsonRPC
  const ethereum = await LavaSDK.create({
    // badge data of an active badge server
    badge: {
      badgeServerAddress: "<badge server address>",
      projectId: "<badge project id>",
    },

    // chainID for Ethereum mainnet
    chainIds: "ETH1",

    // geolocation 1 for North america - geolocation 2 for Europe providers
    // default value is 1
    geolocation: "2",
  });

  // Get latest block number
  const blockNumberResponse = await ethereum.sendRelay({
    method: "eth_blockNumber",
    params: [],
  });
```

# Private Key flow example:

```typescript
const cosmosHub = await LavaSDK.create({
  // private key with an active subscription
  privateKey: "<lava consumer private key>",

  // chainID for Cosmos Hub
  chainIds: "COSMOSHUB",

  // geolocation 1 for North america - geolocation 2 for Europe providers
  // default value is 1
  geolocation: "2",
});

// Get abci_info

const results = [];

for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  const info = await cosmosHub.sendRelay({
    method: "abci_info",
    params: [],
  });

  // Parse and extract response
  const parsedInfo = info.result.response;

  // Extract latest block number
  const latestBlockNumber = parsedInfo.last_block_height;
  // Fetch latest block
  const latestBlock = await cosmosHub.sendRelay({
    method: "block",
    params: [latestBlockNumber],
  });
  results.push(latestBlock);
  console.log("Latest block:", latestBlock);
}
```

### TendermintRPC / JSON-RPC interface:

```typescript
const blockResponse = await lavaSDK.sendRelay({
  method: "block",
  params: ["5"],
});
```

Here, `method` is the RPC method and `params` is an array of strings representing parameters for the method.

You can find more examples for tendermintRPC sendRelay calls [TendermintRPC examples](https://github.com/lavanet/lava-sdk/blob/main/examples/tendermintRPC.ts)

### Rest API interface:

```typescript
const data = await lavaSDK.sendRelay({
  method: "GET",
  url: "/cosmos/bank/v1beta1/denoms_metadata",
  data: {
    "pagination.count_total": true,
    "pagination.reverse": "true",
  },
});
```

In this case, `method` is the HTTP method (either GET or POST), `url` is the REST endpoint, and `data` is the query data.

You can find more examples for rest sendRelay calls [Rest examples](https://github.com/lavanet/lava-sdk/blob/main/examples/restAPI.ts)

# Troubleshooting

### <b> Webpack >= 5 </b>

If you are using `create-react-app` version 5 or higher, or `Angular` version 11 or higher, you may encounter build issues. This is because these versions use `webpack version 5`, which does not include Node.js polyfills.

#### <b> Create-react-app solution </b>

1. Install react-app-rewired and the missing modules:

```bash
yarn add --dev react-app-rewired crypto-browserify stream-browserify browserify-zlib assert stream-http https-browserify os-browserify url buffer process net tls bufferutil utf-8-validate path-browserify
```

2. Create `config-overrides.js` in the root of your project folder, and append the following lines:

```javascript
const webpack = require("webpack");

module.exports = function override(config) {
  const fallback = config.resolve.fallback || {};
  Object.assign(fallback, {
    crypto: require.resolve("crypto-browserify"),
    stream: require.resolve("stream-browserify"),
    assert: require.resolve("assert"),
    http: require.resolve("stream-http"),
    https: require.resolve("https-browserify"),
    os: require.resolve("os-browserify"),
    url: require.resolve("url"),
    zlib: require.resolve("browserify-zlib"),
    fs: false,
    bufferutil: require.resolve("bufferutil"),
    "utf-8-validate": require.resolve("utf-8-validate"),
    path: require.resolve("path-browserify"),
  });
  config.resolve.fallback = fallback;
  config.plugins = (config.plugins || []).concat([
    new webpack.ProvidePlugin({
      process: "process/browser",
      Buffer: ["buffer", "Buffer"],
    }),
  ]);
  config.ignoreWarnings = [/Failed to parse source map/];
  config.module.rules.push({
    test: /\.(js|mjs|jsx)$/,
    enforce: "pre",
    loader: require.resolve("source-map-loader"),
    resolve: {
      fullySpecified: false,
    },
  });
  return config;
};
```

3. In the `package.json` change the script for start, test, build and eject:

```JSON
"scripts": {
    "start": "react-app-rewired start",
    "build": "react-app-rewired build",
    "test": "react-app-rewired test",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject"
},
```
